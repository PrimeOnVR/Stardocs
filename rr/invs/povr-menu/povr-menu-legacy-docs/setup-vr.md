# Setup (VR)

#### VR Setup

* Spawn the POVR Chip
* T pose to open the menu in your watch (or if your POVR Chip has a button, use that)
* Click “Calibrate T-pose”

{% hint style="info" %}
Calibrate your T-Pose by outstretching your hands in a “T” formation.The POVR menu will automatically calculate how long your arm is and snip a little bit of distance from your arms while T-Posing so opening the POVR Menu isn't so tiring.
{% endhint %}
