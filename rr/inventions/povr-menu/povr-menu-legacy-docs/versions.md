# Versions

To identify a version of a POVR Menu, you need to know two things:

* POVR Branch
* POVR Version

The version is in the invention name, but the branch is harder to find.

{% hint style="info" %}
As of now, there is no way to identify branch.
{% endhint %}

The version numbers are labeled like this:

POVR V(1, 2, 3, 4, 4.4, 5) and so on

There are three branches:

* Somone VR Branch
* Prime Branch
* Merged Branch

Both Somone VR and Prime branches are based on POVR V4, and have been modified by their respective person. The merged branch is a merge of both the Somone VR Branch and the Prime Branch, with the best features taken from both.
