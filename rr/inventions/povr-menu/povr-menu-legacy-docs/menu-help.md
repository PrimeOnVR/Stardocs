# Menu Help

If your POVR Menu is not working, please follow these troubleshooting steps:

* Make sure you are on the permission list

If you are not on the permission list, the POVR Menu will not activate for you. If you think you are on the list, attach a “Get All Players” chip to the permission port and try again.

* Make sure you don’t have multiple instances of the POVR Core running

If you have multiple POVR chips spawned, that may cause issues with the POVR Menu’s functionality. If you cannot find a second POVR chip, try despawning it through the store and spawning it again.

* Try running setup

If you have not run setup yet, that may be the cause of your issues. Search this wiki for “Setup” and choose the platform you are on.
