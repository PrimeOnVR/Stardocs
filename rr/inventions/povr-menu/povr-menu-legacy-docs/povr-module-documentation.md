# POVR Module Documentation

### What are modules?

Modules connect to the POVR Menu via the POVR Core, and are little circuits that can be triggered by the menu. They can grab information about the player, control the player and other objects, and overall have full control over the room

### How can I make my own modules?

You can attach any collection of circuits to the port named “addon” and run them via the menu, but if you are going to do this, you should consolidate your chips into a circuit board.

Hint thing: all outputs from addon execs are always local

{% hint style="info" %}
Share your modules with us in the POVR Dev discord!
{% endhint %}
