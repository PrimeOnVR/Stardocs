# Setup (Screenmode)

To setup the POVR menu, we first need to access the calibration menu somehow. There are 3 ways to do this.

#### Item method

* Spawn the menu
* Spawn a basketball
* Throw the basketball until it opens the menu
* Click “Calibrate T pose” in your watch

#### Button Method

In some select version of the POVR Menu, you can open the menu or start the calibration using a button.

Now, we need to calibrate our T-pose. There are 2 ways to do this.

#### Dual hand method

* Start calibration
* Move both hands away from your crosshair until it says “completed”

{% hint style="info" %}
This will not work on PC Screenmode.
{% endhint %}

#### Single hand method (Easier)

* Start calibration
* Move your left/right hand away from your crosshair until it says “completed”

{% hint style="info" %}
After calibrating with either method, move any hand as far as you can (or both) and then check your watch. The POVR Menu should appear.
{% endhint %}
