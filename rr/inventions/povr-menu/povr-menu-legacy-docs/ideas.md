# Ideas

#### Other Ideas

*   Website

    A website for the POVR Menu which can include contact info for a free demo or adding the menu into another room

    This domain would be created and hosted by Google Sites, a free but powerful website making platform

#### Menu Ideas

*   Shut Up Everyone

    Mute everyone in the room but admins, this would toggle on and off
*   Everyone Menu

    Allow everyone to access a trimmed down menu with options to control him or herself, like respawning the player at spawn if they get glitched out the map

    Here is a table to explain more:

    | Authority Level | Access to features |
    | --------------- | ------------------ |
    | Admin           | Full control       |
    | User            | Limited access     |
