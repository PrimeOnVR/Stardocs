# Installation

## Where to get the client

You may find a download link on our Minecraft focused discord server.

This will give you a .mrpack file (modrinth pack) which will install Reflection automatically.

If you already know how to install .mrpack files, you do not need to read the "Installing the Client" section.

Here are some things you may want to know about Reflection Client.

* Reflection Client keybinds are the same as the Rec Room alternate keybinds.
* M is used to open map, C to zoom, X to open Simple Voice Chat, Z to enlarge minimap.
* Clicking the logo on the main menu will pull up this wiki.
* Reflection Client is based off of 1.21.4 (Fabric) Minecraft.
* Before Reflection was a thing, its predecessor was MEV Client, another client (or more importantly, set of clients) by me.
