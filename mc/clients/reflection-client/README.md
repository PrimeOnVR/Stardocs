# Reflection Client

Reflection Client is a client made to be the successor to MEV Flux and Vanilla MEV, and has many of the same features, on a newer version of Minecraft. It has several features, such as Figura, a mod that lets you heavily customize your avatar, better third person, and much more!



Reflection Client has its own custom branding and menu layouts. These menus make the experience feel more unique, but can break sometimes.
