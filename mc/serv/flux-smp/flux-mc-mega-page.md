# Flux MC Mega Page

## Info

This is information about the various server features of Flux SMP. Use this to learn about all the cool things you can do with us!

Just to note: both our Java and Bedrock layers require whitelisting. Please DM any Server Manager on our Discord server to be added. Remember, the Java and Bedrock whitelists are different, so please specify what platform and username you have so we can properly add you.

## Major Planned Events

Here are some events that will happen over time on the server!

* campfire meetup (teaching how to use plots, seeing what members are up to)
* pvp enabling (enabling pvp on the server)
* nether unlocking (unlocking nether)
* pvp arena (making a fighting arena for duels with temp gear)
* trading center (making a hub for players to make shops with guis)
* purge (disabling plot protection and some server rules)
* christmas event (meetup to make a christmas build)
* end unlocking (unlocking end)

## How to join

### Java Tutorial

### Bedrock Tutorial

Bedrock support may vary, but if you cannot access java edition in any way, its a good option to get you started!

## Rules

These are the rules for the MC and Discord server.

* No burning or deleting player items
* No killing players
* No inappropriate signs, chat, or builds. (CANNOT BE BYPASSED)
* No plot trapping or excessive plots (CANNOT BE BYPASSED)
* No destroying or claiming of server landmarks (like large chunks of terrain, or server spawn) without permission. (CANNOT BE BYPASSED)
* No inappropriate, loud, or high range music discs (CANNOT BE BYPASSED)
* No hacking, cheating, or using illegal modifications like Xray (CANNOT BE BYPASSED)
* No bypassing or breaking the claim system or other systems set by us (CANNOT BE BYPASSED)

Certain rules, like burning items, can be bypassed in your own plots, but signs need to be clearly visible for any rules being modified inside your plot. These signs cannot be hidden in any way, or they are deemed invalid.

During server events like a Purge, these rules may be bypassed.

## Added commands and items

There are many commands and items different than normal Minecraft that you can use, and here are all the ones you can use and access, as a player on our server.

### Discord Link

If you join our Discord Server, you'll see that your messages get relayed from discord to our server and our server to discord. However, our functions go beyond a simple message link. Here are some things you can do with this.

#### Automatic role colors

Role colors from people on Discord will show up in your in game chat. Its that easy!

#### Discord linking

You can link your Discord account to your MC account by doing /link in MC and following the instructions. Please note that linking is permanent, and the only way to unlink your profile is to rejoin the Discord server!

### MC Bedrock via Geyser

If you want to play our server on a platform other than java, we support bedrock compatibility via geyser. Here are the things that geyser can do for you.

#### Joining via Geyser

To join our server (assuming you've already got your bedrock account whitelisted) you will need to add our server info to your server list. Please enter this info below exactly, as it is not the same as the Java server info.

SERVER ADDRESS:

fluxsmp.mcserv.fun

PORT:

26988

#### Linking to your Java account

If you want to sync your progress between your Java and Bedrock accounts, you can run the /linkaccount (USERNAME) command in MC while both your Java and Bedrock accounts are online.

You can also use /unlinkaccount to unlink your account.

### Audio Player

Audio Player allows you to write sounds to music discs and goat horns. Here are the things you can do.

#### Upload

running /audioplayer upload in MC will guide you through the process of setting up a song.

Please note that loud or NSFW music or having your range on your music disc be too big can result in a warning or ban.

### Plots

On this server, you can set up plots to protect your items and change certain rules inside your plots. Here are some things you can do.

#### Setting up a plot

You can craft a Gold Hoe and right click at two corners of your base to set up a plot. From there, you can configure it, and change it how you need it to be.

#### Plot configuration

By default, plots block interaction of almost anything, and for certain plots, you may want to modify that. To do this, send the command /flan menu while standing in your plot to modify roles, delete your plot if needed, and much more.

#### Plot technicalities

If you do not log on for a long time, your plot will be deleted, to keep the server healthy and lasting.

Plot areas go up to 10 blocks down, and infinitely up.

Although you start out with a small plot claiming area, the more time that you spend on the server, the more plot blocks you get to use. You can use /flan expand (number) to expand your plot that number of blocks in the direction you are facing.

### Shops (NOT DONE)

SHOPS BY DEFAULT DO NOT HAVE PROTECTION AGAINST YOUR STOCK!! PROTECT IT

#### Crafting (NOT DONE)

W = Wood\
B = Wool\
I = Iron\
X = Nothing

W B W

W I W

X X X

This will craft a shop block.

#### Setting up (NOT DONE)

SHOPS BY DEFAULT DO NOT HAVE PROTECTION AGAINST YOUR STOCK!! PROTECT IT

## Small stuff

Here are some small tweaks we made to gameplay:

* Crossbows can have bow enchants
* Axes can have sword enchants
* Villagers can trade infinitely
* Double doors and trapdoors will both open as one
* Leads are better and easier to use
* During first few days of server opening, nether is locked
* Crafted rails give more rails per rail
* Minecarts are 2X speed
* Horses and other mounts don't move when saddled
