# Flux SMP

Flux SMP was a server made by WilRhy and Prime, with WilRhy paying for hosting, and Prime working on the backend, to test the extents of modding and have fun.

The server had its own documentation pages, clients, and much more.

It was shut down due to inactivity, and sadly never made it to opening the end.
