# pluhpluh52 SMP

pluhpluh52 SMP was a server originally owned by Willow, however, after using certain commands that broke the world, Prime took over the server, and transferred it to a new base. After the transfer, various lightweight optimization mods were added, and a client was made to tie in to some of those mods. This transfer was also met with controversy, leading to various server moves and a split in the server's community. This in turn, killed the server.
