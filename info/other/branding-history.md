# Name History

Starlight went by many names before landing on Starlight, such as:

* Four Corners (during the Four Corners game)
* Slice (during Slice Hub and Slice AMAs)
* Shard (during Better Freeze Tag)
* Starlight Studios (during Ability Cubes)

Before finally landing on "Starlight" during Wand Arena's creation!

Each of these branding styles had their own logos at the time of their creation!
