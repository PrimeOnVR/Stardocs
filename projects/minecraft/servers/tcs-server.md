# TCS Server

TCS (Trial Chamber Server) was a server made by WilRhy to try and find a trial chamber. After some time however, the server became laggier as more people joined and played on the server. With attempts from WilRhy to fix the lag, the server became fully broken and was unable to start. Because of this, the server was transferred to Prime, which managed and fixed the server from then on. This transfer was met with some controversy, however, and some members had gotten angry and left the server due to this.
